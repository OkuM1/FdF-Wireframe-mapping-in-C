# FdF

**FdF** is a simple 3D wireframe visualizer for maps. It uses MiniLibX to render a wireframe representation of landscapes based on heightmaps.

## Features

- Basic 3D wireframe rendering.
- Map loading from input files.
- Zoom, rotation, and translation controls.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OkuM1/FdF-Wireframe-mapping-in-C.git
    cd FdF-Wireframe-mapping-in-C
    ```

2. Compile the project with `make`:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. Ensure MiniLibX and necessary libraries are installed (automatically cloned if missing).

## Usage

Run the program with a map file:
```bash
./fdf path/to/map.fdf
```
